 * \brief SSC I2S example driver.
 *
 * This file defines a useful set of functions for the SSC I2S interface on
 * AVR32 devices. The driver handles normal polled usage and direct memory
 * access (PDC) usage.
 *
 * - Compiler:           IAR EWAVR32 and GNU GCC for AVR32
 * - Supported devices:  All AVR32 devices with an SSC module can be used.
 * - AppNote:
