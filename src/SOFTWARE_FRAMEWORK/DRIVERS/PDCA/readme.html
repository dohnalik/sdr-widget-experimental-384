<h1 align="center" class="whs1">AVR UC3 Series Software Framework: Peripheral DMA Controller (PDCA) Driver<br>
</h1>

<p align="center" class="whs2">Copyright &copy; 2007 Atmel Corporation</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Peripheral DMA controller (PDCA) transfers data between on-chip peripheral modules such
as USART, SPI, SSC and on- and off-chip memories. Using the PDCA avoids CPU intervention
for data transfers, improving the performance of the microcontroller. The PDCA can transfer
data from memory to a peripheral or from a peripheral to memory.</p>
<p>The PDCA consists of a number of DMA channels. Each channel has:
<li>A 32-bit memory pointer</li>
<li>A 16-bit transfer counter</li>
<li>A 32-bit memory pointer reload value</li>
<li>A 16-bit transfer counter reload value</li>
<p>The PDCA communicates with the peripheral modules over a number of handshake interfaces.
The peripheral signals to the PDCA when it is ready to receive or transmit data. The PDCA
acknowledges the request when the transmission has started.</p>
<p>The number of handshake-interfaces may be higher than the number of DMA channels. If this is
the case, the DMA channel must be programmed to use the desired interface.</p>
<p>When a transmit buffer is empty or a receive buffer is full, an interrupt request can be signalled.</p>

<h2>INTC Software Driver</h2>

    <p>This driver provides an API to get access to the main features of the PDCA controller.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The driver is composed of :
     <li><a href="PDCA.c">PDCA.c</a> </li>
     <li><a href="PDCA.h">PDCA.h</a> (for accurate API description, read this header file).</li>
     
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>PDCA Software Driver Examples</h2>
    <p>One examples are currently available:
       <li><a href="./EXAMPLE/readme.html">The given example is a transfer of an ASCII Array stored in internal flash to the usrat output.
 using PDCA.</a></li>
