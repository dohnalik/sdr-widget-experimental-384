 *
 * \brief Rotary Encoder driven Dual Speed VFO and Menu selector, driven by
 * two Interrupt inputs, NMI and EXT_INT7.  Three encoder outputs provided
 * in the form of global (voaltile) values:
 *
 * (int32_t) freq_delta_from_enc is an incremental value to be added directly to
 * the uint32_t value representing the Si570 frequency.  One revolution of the
 * Encoder corresponds to an increment of 4kHz (Si570 frequency is divided by 4).
 * If the Encoder is turned for more than 1/5th of a turn at an angular speed
 * greater than defined in rotary_encoder.h, then the faster rate of the dual
 * speed function kicks in, and each revolution of the Encoder results in an
 * increment of 100 times the normal rate.  This function becomes inactive in
 * 1/3 of a second, or if briefly turned in the opposite direction, as defined
 * in rotary_encoder.h.
 * Associated with freq_delta_from_enc, there is also the (volatile) bool
 * FRQ_fromenc, indicating whether a new value is available as a result of turning
 * the encoder.
 *
 * (int8_t) menu_steps_from_enc is an incremental value which increases by 10 for
 * each turn of the Rotary Encoder.  This value is used by the Menu function in
 * taskPushButtonMenu.c.
 * Associated menu_steps_from_enc, there is also the (volatile) bool MENU_fromenc,
 * indicating whether a new value is available as a result of turning the encoder.
 *
 * (int16_t) val_steps_from_enc is an incremental value which increases by 100 for
 * each turn of the Rotary Encoder.  This value is used by the Menu function in
 * taskPushButtonMenu.c
 * Associated val_steps_from_enc, there is also the (volatile) bool VALUE_fromenc,
 * indicating whether a new value is available as a result of turning the encoder.
