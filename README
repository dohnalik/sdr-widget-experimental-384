SDR-Widget is an interface based on the Atmel AT32UC3A3 microcontroller that provides the following functionality to SDR circuits such as the SoftRock.

   1. High quality audio using the USB Audio Class standard (UAC1 and UAC2)
   2. PTT control
   3. Si570 control
   4. SWR metering
   5. PWR metering
   6. PA Heatsink Temperature metering
   7. PA bias adjustment
   8. LCD display
   9. Rotary Encoder Input
  10. Filter bank switching control
  11. CW paddle 

The interface also aims to be used as a general platform for future experimentation with SDR peripherals.

A branch of the widget, called the audiophile-widget, will provide the USB-I2S
module for mating with various Analog Board (AB) designs featuring different
DAC, IV conversion, buffer/amplification, and power supplies. AB-1 is based
on the ES9022 DAC.  One future AB will feature an FPGA for added 
functionalities.

The firmware source files are hosted at github:

git://github.com/amontefusco/sdr-widget.git        (for readonly access)

Interested would be developers please contact us.

The master branch is for the sdr-widget, and the audio-widget branch is 
for the audio-widget.

To build under Cygwin or Linux, first download Atmel AVR32 tools from
http://www.atmel.no/beta_ware/
Then edit the make-widget script to match your tools installation. 

Build commands are "make audio-widget" and "make sdr-widget".
